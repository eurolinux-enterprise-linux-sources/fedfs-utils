.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
A FedFS domain's namespace is joined together via
.IR junctions .
When a file-access client encounters a junction on a file server,
the file server provides a list of locations where that client
can access the target file set to which the juntion refers.
.P
In a FedFS domain, these location lists are stored on one or more LDAP servers,
known as
.IR "namespace databases" ,
or
.IR NSDBs ,
for short.
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers access the information stored
on NSDBs via standard LDAP queries.
Tools that administer a FedFS domain use ldapmodify queries
to manage information stored on an NSDB.
File-access clients have no need to access NSDBs directly.
.P
Further information about junctions and NSDBs is available in
.BR fedfs (7).
.SH DESCRIPTION
The FedFS NSDB Proposed Standard allows flexible use
of any LDAP server and its Directory Information Tree
to store and manage NSDB information.
.P
The
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
command provides a simplified but fully capable stand-alone
NSDB based specifically on OpenLDAP.
Using this command,
you can install a fresh NSDB, or back up or restore your NSDB data.
It can even construct a self-signed x.509 certificate to enable
secure NSDB queries.
.SS Operation
The
.B install
subcommand sets up an empty NSDB, ready to be used in a FedFS domain.
The new NSDB replaces any OpenLDAP configuration
that may already exist on the system.
OpenLDAP must already be installed on the system.
.P
Once the new NSDB is running,
FedFS fileset location information is stored as records
in a Directory Information Tree under the NCE.
This information is managed with commands like
.BR nsdb-create-fsn (8).
.P
A handful of parameters are needed to set up the new NSDB.
These are gathered via a brief interview.
The domain name and administrator credentials are provided during
this interview.
Passwords are not checked for strength,
however blank passwords are not permitted.
.P
The baseline security requirements for the NSDB are specified
at install time using the
.B \-\-security=
option.  See the
.B SECURITY
section for an in-depth discussion.
.P
Once set up with the
.B install
subcommand, OpenLDAP listens for LDAP queries on the standard LDAP port (389).
The underlying LDAP server can be configured like any other OpenLDAP server
using the new-style
.I cn=config
configuration interface.
.P
To display the current status of the NSDB service on the local host, use the
.B status
subcommand.
Information about the local NSDB service is displayed, including whether
the LDAP service is started, whether it actually is an NSDB, and
whether TLS security is required to use it.
.P
The
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
command also provides backup and restore facilities.
The
.B backup
subcommand saves location information stored on the local NSDB
to a dated LDIF file.
LDIF files created by the
.B backup
command are stored in the
.I @statedir@/nsdb-backup
directory by default.
.P
The
.B restore
subcommand completely replaces the contents of the NSDB with a backup
contained in of one of the previously saved LDIF files.
The
.B restore
subcommand takes one positional argument, which is the name of
the backup to restore.
A list of backups is displayed by using the
.B restore
subcommand with no argument.
.P
The
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
command must run as root.
A audit log of each
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
operation is stored in
.IR @statedir@/nsdb-jumpstart.log .
.SS Subcommands
Valid
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
subcommands are:
.IP "\fBinstall\fP"
Replace the OpenLDAP configuration on the local system with
a ready-built NSDB.
The user is asked to confirm before action is taken.
.IP
Specifying the
.B \-\-security=
option sets the transport security that the NSDB requires
clients to use when communicating with it.
.IP "\fBstatus\fP"
Display the status of the NSDB on the local system.
This subcommand takes no arguments.
.IP "\fBbackup\fP"
Generate an LDIF containing the NSDB information stored
on the local LDAP server.
The LDIF is stored in a dated file under
.IR @statedir@/nsdb-backup .
This subcommand takes no arguments.
.IP "\fBrestore\fP"
Replace the NSDB information on the local LDAP server
with the contents of an LDIF.
This subcommand takes a backup name as an argument.
If no backup name is given,
a list of backups that can be restored is displayed.
The user is asked to confirm before action is taken.
.SS Command line options
The following options are specified before the subcommand on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-\-help"
Displays usage and copyright information, then exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-version"
Displays fedfs-utils version information, then exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-stateidr=\fIpathname\fP"
Specifies the pathname of the local directory
under which NSDB data is maintained.
By default, this directory is
.IR @statedir@ .
.SS Subcommand options
.IP "\fB\-\-security=\fImode\fP"
Selects the security mode of the NSDB.
This option may be specified only on the
.B install
subcommand.
Valid
.I mode
values are
.B none
and
.BR tls .
.P
If
.B none
is specified, or the
.B \-\-security=
option is not specified, clients can connect to this NSDB in the clear.
.P
If
.B tls
is specified, the
.B install
subcommand creates a self-signed x.509 certificate,
and configures the NSDB so that clients are required to use TLS
when connecting to the NSDB.
.SH EXIT CODES
The
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
command returns one of two values upon exit.
.TP
.B 0
The subcommand succeeded.
.TP
.B 1
The subcommand failed.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain.
After you have chosen a reliable server in the
.I example.net
domain to act as your NSDB, log in on that server as root,
ensure that OpenLDAP is installed,
and that any configuration can be discarded.
.P
To create a new NSDB with a self-signed certificate for the
.I example.net
domain, use:
.RS
.sp
# ./nsdb-jumpstart install --security=tls
.br
This command is about to replace the OpenLDAP configuration on this system.
.br
Do you want to continue? [y/N] y
.br

#
.RE
.SH SECURITY
The NSDB created by the
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
command allows anonymous read access to the NCE and all entries under it.
The LDAP server's rootDSE is also readable by anyone.
An NSDB client must bind with administrator privileges
to update NSDB records for a FedFS domain.
ACLs may be adjusted after the NSDB is set up with
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8).
.P
Before binding, however, NSDB clients must connect to the NSDB to use it.
The
.B \-\-security=
setting determines what type of transport layer security is required
to connect to the NSDB.
.P
When the
.B \-\-security=none
option is specified during NSDB setup,
or if no
.B \-\-security=
setting is specified,
NSDB clients can connect to the NSDB using an unencrypted
connection to the standard LDAP port (389).
.P
By specifying the
.B \-\-security=tls
option on the
.BR nsdb-jumpstart (8)
command, a self-signed x.509 certificate is created
that NSDB clients must use to authenticate the NSDB and its contents.
The underlying LDAP server requires the use of TLS
and the use of AES or better encryption when a client access the NSDB.
The NSDB never authenticates its clients.
.P
To use this NSDB, the new certificate material must be distributed
to NSDB clients (fileservers and administrative systems)
and installed using the
.BR nsdbparams (8)
command, or it can be transferred directly to NSDB clients that
are running the
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
daemon.
.P
The use of a transport encryption mechanism such as TLS is
strongly recommended to protect NSDB requests on untrusted networks.
SASL is currently not supported for the NSDB protocol.
