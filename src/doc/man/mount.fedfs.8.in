.TH MOUNT.FEDFS 8 "@pubdate@"
.SH NAME
mount.fedfs \- mount a FedFS domain root
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mount.fedfs
.I remotedir localdir
.RB [ \-fhnrsvVw ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
The
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
command locates FedFS domains by looking for DNS SRV records
that advertise file servers exporting FedFS domain root replicas.
The
.I remotedir
argument determines what FedFS domain is mounted and
what network file system protocol is used.
.P
The
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
command sorts the list of available domain root replicas
according to the SRV record sorting rules outlined in RFC 2782.
It attempts to contact each file server
appearing in the SRV record list
until a mount request succeeds
or the end of the SRV record list is reached.
.SS Command line arguments
The first argument,
.IR remotedir ,
is the
.I globally useful name
to mount.
Globally useful names are discussed in more detail in
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
The second argument,
.IR localdir ,
specifies the local directory on which to mount the requested
FedFS globally useful name.
As with other file systems,
.I localdir
must exist on the client for a mount request to succeed.
.P
The
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
command converts the specified
.I remotedir
and
.I localdir
arguments, along with information obtained via DNS SRV queries,
to arguments suitable for a local mount request.
It then forks and execs the
appropriate file system mount subcommand (such as the
.BR mount.nfs (8)
subcommand) to mount the file server where the domain root resides.
.P
Because an unmodified file system mount subcommand
is used for the actual mount operation,
the file system's equivalent umount subcommand
is all that is required to unmount this mount point when it is
finished being used.
.SS Mount option inheritance
The Linux NFS client treats an NFS referral
as a server-initiated mount request.
The referring fileserver provides only a list of server names and export paths.
The mount options for this new mount are inherited from the new mount
point's parent directory on the client.
.P
As applications proceed deeper into a domain's namespace,
they can encounter both file sets to which they have
read-only access, and file sets to which they have read-write
access.
To allow applications proper access to both types of file sets,
typically file-access clients mount domain root directories in read-write mode.
All submounts of the domain root are then mounted read-write as well.
Write access is then controlled by fileservers.
.P
For example, a domain root may contain an NFS version 4 referral to an
export containing user home directories.
The domain root may be exported read-only so file-access clients cannot update it,
but user home directories would not be very useful if they could not be
written to by their owners.
The fileserver continues to employ user credentials to limit access
as appropriate.
.P
Network file system clients follow file system referrals
as applications encounter them,
which is similar to how an automounter works.
Consider the initial mount of the domain root
as if you are mounting a single whole file system,
even though underneath, additional NFS mounts come and go as needed.
.SS Options
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-fake"
Fake mount.  This option is ignored by
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
but is passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Print the
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
usage message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-no\-mtab\fP"
Do not update
.IR /etc/mtab .
This option is ignored by
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
but is passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-options \fIoptions\fP"
Specify mount options for this mount point and all submounts.
These are ignored by
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
but are passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand.
For further details, refer to
.BR mount (8).
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-ro, \-\-read\-only\fP"
Mount the domain root and all submounts read-only.
.IP "\fB\-s, \-\-sloppy\fP"
Tolerate unrecognized mount options.  This is ignored by
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
but is passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand.
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP"
Report more information during the mount process.
This affects
.BR mount.fedfs (8)
and is also passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand.
.IP "\fB\-V, \-\-version\fP"
Print version information for
.BR mount.fedfs(8)
and exit.
.IP "\fB\-w, \-\-rw, \-\-read-write\fP"
Mount the domain root and all submounts read-write.  This is the default behavior.
.SH EXAMPLES
To mount the domain root of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain via NFS version 4 automatically, you might add this to your
.IR /etc/fstab :
.RS
.sp
/nfs4/example.net   /nfs4/example.net   fedfs  defaults  0  0
.sp
.RE
A FedFS domain root can also be mounted with a stand-alone invocation of
.BR mount (8):
.RS
.sp
# mount -t fedfs /nfs4/example.net /mnt/fedfs
.sp
.RE
This mounts the FedFS domain root for the
.I example.net
domain on the client's
.I /mnt/fedfs
directory.
A simple
.RS
.sp
# umount /mnt/fedfs
.sp
.RE
unmounts it when you are finished with it.
