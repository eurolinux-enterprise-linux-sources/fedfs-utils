.SH INTRODUCTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
FedFS-enabled file servers allow remote administrative access via an
authenticated RPC protocol known as the
.IR "FedFS ADMIN protocol" .
Using this protocol, FedFS administrators manage
FedFS junctions and NSDB connection parameter information
on remote FedFS-enabled file servers.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fedfs-lookup-replication (8)
command is part of a collection of low-level single-use programs
that is intended for testing the FedFS ADMIN protocol or for use in scripts.
It sends a single FEDFS_LOOKUP_REPLICATION request to a remote
FedFS ADMIN protocol service.
.P
The FEDFS_LOOKUP_REPLICATION request causes a remote server
to reveal the contents of a replication marker,
or to report cached or immediate NSDB lookup results as that server sees them.
The
.BR fedfs-lookup-replication (8)
command takes a single positional parameter which is the
pathname on the remote server of the junction to be looked up.
The pathname is relative to the root
of the local file system on the remote server.
.P
Resolving a junction means performing an NSDB query with the contents
of the junction to obtain a list of fileset locations, or FSLs,
matching the stored UUID.
The meaning of these is described in more detail in
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
There are three distinct types of replication lookup:
.TP
.B none
The remote server reports the actual contents of the replication stored
on its local disk.
This includes a UUID and the name and port of an NSDB.
If the
.B \-t
option is not specified, this type of lookup is performed.
.TP
.B cache
The remote server reports lookup results it may have cached from
previous replication lookup requests.
This includes a UUID, the name and port of an NSDB, and the cached
list of fileset locations matching the UUID in the replication marker.
Not all FedFS ADMIN service implementations support this type of request.
.TP
.B nsdb
The remote server performs a fresh replication lookup,
and the results are returned.
This includes an UUID, the name and port of an NSDB,
and a list of fileset locations matching the UUID in the replication marker.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Enables debugging messages during operation.
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Displays
.BR fedfs-lookup-replication (8)
version information and a usage message on
.IR stderr .
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-hostname=\fIhostname\fP"
Specifies the hostname of a remote FedFS ADMIN service.
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR localhost .
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-nettype=\fInettype\fP"
Specifies the transport to use when contacting the remote FedFS ADMIN service.
Typically the
.I nettype
is one of
.B tcp
or
.BR udp .
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR netpath .
See
.BR rpc (3t)
for details.
.IP "\fB\-p, \-\-path=\fIpathname\fP"
Specifies the location on the remote server where the target FedFS replication
resides.
This pathname is relative to the remote server's physical root directory,
not the remote server's NFS pseudoroot.
.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-resolvetype=\fItype\fP"
Specifies the desired type of resolution.  Valid values for
.I type
are
.BR 0 ,
.BR none ,
.BR fedfs_resolve_none ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR cache ,
.BR fedfs_resolve_cache ,
.BR 2 ,
.BR nsdb ", or"
.BR fedfs_resolve_nsdb .
The value is not case-sensitive.
If this option is not specified, the default value is
.BR none .
.IP "\fB\-s, \-\-security=\fIflavor\fP"
Specifies the security flavor to use
when contacting the remote FedFS ADMIN service.
Valid flavors are
.BR sys ,
.BR unix ,
.BR krb5 ,
.BR krb5i ", and"
.BR krb5p .
If this option is not specified, the
.B unix
flavor is used.
See the
.B SECURITY
section of this man page for details.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you are the FedFS administrator of the
.I example.net
FedFS domain and that your domain's NSDB hostname is
.IR nsdb.example.net .
You have created a FedFS replication on file server
.IR fs.example.net .
To see how the replication appears on the remote server, use:
.RS
.sp
$ fedfs-lookup-replication -h fs.example.net /export/replication1
.br
Call completed successfully
.br
FSN UUID: 89c6d208-7280-11e0-9f1d-000c297fd679
.br
NSDB: nsdb.example.net:389
.sp
.RE
To see real-time replication resolution results as the remote server sees them, use:
.RS
.sp
$ fedfs-lookup-replication -h fs.example.net -t nsdb /export/replication1
.br
Server returned FEDFS_ERR_NSDB_NOFSN
.sp
.RE
In this example, the replication marker exists on the file server,
but the domain's NSDB has not yet been updated to contain a list of
fileset locations for the UUID contained in the replication marker.
The file server is therefore not able to resolve the replication.
.SH SECURITY
By default, or if the
.B sys
and
.B unix
flavors are specified with the
.BI \-\-security= flavor
option, the
.BR fedfs-create-junction (8)
command uses AUTH_SYS security for the Remote Procedure Call.
AUTH_SYS has known weaknesses and should be avoided on untrusted networks.
.P
The RPC client uses the Kerberos v5 GSS mechanism
if a Kerberos security flavor is specified.
When specifying a Kerberos security flavor,
the user must first obtain a valid Kerberos ticket using
.BR kinit (1)
before running
.BR fedfs-create-junction (8).
.P
The AUTH_NONE security flavor is no longer supported by this implementation.
