.TH RPC.FEDFSD 8 "@pubdate@"
.SH NAME
rpc.fedfsd \- FedFS administrative service daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpc.fedfsd
.RB [ \-?dF ]
.RB [ \-u
.IR uid ]
.RB [ \-g
.IR gid ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR port ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short).
FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism
by which system administrators construct
a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using
.IR "file system referrals" .
For further details, see
.BR fedfs (7).
.P
The
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
daemon runs on file servers participating in a FedFS domain.
It enables secure remote administration of junctions on that file server.
A remote FedFS administrative client can identify new NSDBs, update an
NSDB's connection parameters (security information and DNS name), and
create and delete FedFS junctions on that file server.
.P
Because
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
can operate on any object in an file server's local file systems,
FedFS administrative clients should use strong security
such as Kerberos when communicating with
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8).
.SS Command line arguments
.IP "\fB\-?, \-\-help"
Prints
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
version and usage message on
.IR stderr ,
then exits.
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-debug"
Enables additional debugging messages to be produced during operation.
.IP "\fB\-F, \-\-foreground"
Keeps
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
attached to its controlling terminal so that operation
can be monitored directly, or run under a debugger.
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
also writes log messages on
.I stderr
instead of to the system log.
If this option is not specified,
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
backgrounds itself soon after it starts.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-uid=\fIid\fP"
Specifies the numeric or text UID that
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
runs under after dropping root privileges.
By default, the UID for the user
.I @fedfsuser@
is used.
If that user doesn't exist, then the UID for
.I nobody
is used instead.
.IP "\fB\-g, \-\-gid=\fIid\fP"
Specifies the numeric or text GID that
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
runs under after dropping root privileges.
By default, the GID for the group
.I @fedfsuser@
is used.
If that group doesn't exist, then the GID for
.I nobody
is used instead.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-port=\fInum\fP"
Specifies the port number used for RPC listener sockets.
If this option is not specified,
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
chooses a random ephemeral port for each listener socket.
.SS Access control
An Access Control List stored in
.I /etc/fedfsd/access.conf
manages whom
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
allows to perform ADMIN operations.
The following access types are supported:
.IP "\fBnone\fP"
Enabling
.B none
allows anyone using
.B AUTH_NONE
security to perform ADMIN operations.
.B none
is for backwards compatibility only.
It is not recommended for use in production deployments.
.IP "\fBunix\fP"
This setting specifies lists of users and groups who are allowed to use
.B AUTH_SYS
security to perform ADMIN operations.
Though the
.B unix
setting
provides more security than the
.BR none
setting,
.B unix
is not recommended for use on untrusted networks.
.IP "\fBgss\fP"
This setting specifies which GSS mechanisms, services, and principals
are authorized to perform ADMIN operations.
Currently the only supported GSS mechanism is
.BR kerberos_v5 .
.P
See comments in
.I /etc/fedfsd/access.conf
for details on syntax of the Access Control List.
.P
To enable Kerberos security via GSS, a service principal for the
.B fedfs-admin
service must be created for each host running
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8).
The resulting key must be retrieved from the KDC
and stored in a keytab file (usually
.IR /etc/krb5.keytab )
on each host running
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8).
.P
The exact procedure for creating a service principal and retrieving
and storing a secret key for it depends on the type of KDC
in use for the local Kerberos realm.
Consult your local Kerberos realm administrator for more information.
.SH NOTES
To create, resolve, or delete a junction, FedFS admin clients
specify the pathname of that junction as an argument to the
requested operation.
The FedFS admin protocol supports at least two types of these
pathnames:
.IR ADMIN ,
and
.IR NFS .
At this time the Linux
.BR rpc.fedfs (8)
daemon supports only FedFS ADMIN pathnames.
This type of pathname represents a fully-qualified POSIX pathname
relative to the file server's physical root directory.
.P
During each start-up,
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
verifies that the local NSDB connection parameter database exists
and is accessible.
If it does not exist,
.BR rpc.fedfsd (8)
attempts to create such a database.
If it cannot, the daemon fails to start.
.SH FILES

.I @statedir@/nsdbparam.sqlite3
database of NSDB connection parameters

.I @statedir@/nsdbcerts
local directory that stores X.509 certificates for NSDBs
